# MyTextFieldsDelegateTests
This is a text field test, using delegates.

The first delegate MyZipCodeDelegate will restrict the textfield length to 5 chars at max, 
the second MyCurrancyFormatDelegate will get the value that it's been typed and go displaying formatted as currency,
e.g. user type 123, you will see $0,01 then $0,12 and $1.23. Also I have enabled the backspace.
